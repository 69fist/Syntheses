\subsection{Impact}
Compared to other technologies (video,GSM,\ldots), RFID has several issue
concerning privacy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tags cannot be switched-off
    \item Passive tags answer without the agreement of their bearers
    \item Easy to analyze the logs of the readers
    \item Increasing of the communication range
    \item Tags can be almost invisible
\end{itemize}
Privacy issues concerning RFID is being seriously considered by authorites.

\subsection{Information Meaningful by Itself}
Privacy issues appear when the data sent by the tag reveals information
intrinsic to the marked object or the holder of the object
\footnote{With MOBIB card, personal data are stored in the clear in the card}.

\subsection{Mitigating the Problem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kill command to destroy the tag
    \item Use a faraday cages or a blocker tags to
    avoid clandestine query.
    \item \ldots
\end{itemize}
The problem with these solutions is that they are not convenient.
\paragraph{Note:} Nowadays more and more data are collected, it is called
logphilia. But with all these data, information may eventually leak.

The consequence of these information's leakage must be evalutated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does all these data need to be store?
    \item Encryption of the sensitive data on the tag in the dtabases
    \item Authentication for accessing the data
    \item Establishing policies to define who can access the data
\end{itemize}
